# Knapsack-Problem
Several algorithms for solving 1/0 knapsack problem / combinatorial optimization in Python

1)	Problem Description
    Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value.
    Determine which items to be included in a collection so that the total weight is no more than a limited knapsack size and        the total value is as large as possible

2)	Implemented algorithms
    •	cost/weight ratio
    •	dynamic programming
    •	Monte Carlo simulation
    
3)	Main Objectives
    Given a certain knapsack size, choose which items to put in the knapsack
    Given a mix of the size, choose the size with items put in the knapsack
