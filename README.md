# Knapsack-Problem
Several algorithms for solving 1/0 knapsack problem / combinatorial optimization in Python

1)	**Problem Description**  
    Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value  
    Determine which items to be included in a collection so that the total weight is no more than a limited knapsack size and        the total value is as large as possible  

2)	**Implemented algorithms**  
    •	dynamic programming  
    •	Monte Carlo simulation  
    
3)	**Main Objectives**  
    Given a certain knapsack size, choose which items to put in the knapsack  
    Given a mix of the size, choose the size with items put in the knapsack  
    
4)	**Files**  
    •	Test_example
        weight of item; value of item
    •	Solution  
    •	Report 
        weight of item; value of item
        sequence of 0/1: : if the i-th element of sequence equal to 1 then we take the i-th item to knapsack overwise we don't take the item to knapsack
